00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Lets see. Entities, we looked at this in the lab session


2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and talked a littlebit about it another day

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Sometimes we want to dim the light

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
*tries different switches*

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Is this good? More? OK!

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Sometimes we want to make special characters, or code

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For example if we want to write some characters in spanish

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then we used entities, that start with Ampersand

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.011
